Main Idea: use transfer learning
-> use a baseline CNN?
-> use a baseline CNN architecture for Inception, YOLO, MobileNet, googLeNet w/o transfer learning

Stretch Idea: use feature-extraction vectors from CNNs as input to some other models
-> SVM
-> some other classifiers

Stretch Idea: ensemble methods

Meet on Friday
-> brainstorming on transfer learning, MNIST, and ensemble methods
-> Elliot: work on Inception
-> Samy: work on YOLO

-> add FC Linear layer at the end of FC CNN
-> split train//val .9/.1
-> make sure to use the same params as Elliot
