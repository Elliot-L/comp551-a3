Main Idea: use transfer learning
-> use a baseline CNN?; done
-> use a baseline CNN architecture for Inception, YOLO, MobileNet, googLeNet w/o transfer learning

Stretch Idea: use feature-extraction vectors from CNNs as input to some other models
-> SVM
-> some other classifiers

Stretch Idea: ensemble methods

Meet on Friday
-> brainstorming on transfer learning, MNIST, and ensemble methods
-> Elliot: work on Inception
-> Samy: work on YOLO

-> add FC Linear layer at the end of FC CNN; done
-> split train//val .9/.1; done, but with parameters
-> make sure to use the same params as Elliot

-> make a deeper CNN to run on AWS
-> figure out how to ssh/sftp/run stuff onto AWS
-> ensemble stuff; use KNN but use the output of last layer -- Elliot knows
-> use batch norm for quick perf boost
-> add external info by fetching other mnist datasets?
